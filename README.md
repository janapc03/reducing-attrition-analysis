# Reducing Attrition Analysis

Employee attrition has long been a concerns of many companies. The departure of a good employee can affect a company in many ways, which can lead to decreased performance, increased costs, and challenges in recruiting and training new employees. If the reasons for employee attrition can be identified, it can help the company to take steps in the future to avoid, as much as possible, a large number of employees leaving the company.

In our analysis we will use logistic regression to attempt to answer the following question of interest: do gender and the distance an employee works from home have an effect on attrition, and are the effects of distance from home on attrition different for women compared to men?
