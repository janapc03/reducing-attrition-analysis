# Reducing Attrition Analysis

Employee attrition has long been a concerns of many companies. The departure of a good employee can affect an organization in many ways, including decreased performance, increased costs, and challenges in recruiting and training new employees. If the primary reasons for employee attrition can be identified, companies can use the information to take preventative measures in order to avoid a large number of employees leaving the organization. The purpose of this analysis is to discern whether gender and the distance an employee works from home has an effect on attrition, and if such effects are different for women compared to men.

The analysis involves conducting a hypothesis test using logistic regression. All code was completed in R using JupyterNotebook.
