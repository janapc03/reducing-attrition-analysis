    "The HR Analytics dataset was generated by IBM by collecting information from its employees through a survey. The focus of this dataset is on attrition in the workforce: the departure of employees from an organization for reasons such as resignation, retirement, termination, or medical issues. Specifically, the intended use of this data is to assess whether or not there is a relationship between multiple factors and employee attrition, and which factors are most influential. It includes 1470 total observations and 35 variables."

    "The focus of this analysis will be to answer the following question: Can we predict potential attrition cases based on the distance an employee works from home, and do these predictions differ between women and men? Using the HR Analytics data, we can explore the relationship between variables and infer whether men or women who work far from home are more prone to attrition and generate a model that can be used to predict whether or not an employee will leave the organization based on the distance their home is from the office and their gender. This question is focused on both prediction and inference, as the goal is to predict potential attrition cases while drawing conclusions about the population."
